What I enjoyed.

The framework is easy to follow along in the tutorial. Passing props to make code simpler to read and still achieve a dynamic website. 

Things I did not enjoy. 

The intial setup could not get nmp working properly with installs and unistalls and even repairs. Took a classmate saying they had the same issue and found a resolution to get the proper files to download. 

Something entertaining.

The gladiator has all entertainment you could ever need and seahorses like octupus can camoflauge.
